## Introduction

- When making electronic deposits to the church bank accounts please ensure the correct bank account is used.
- Some saints have been making deposits to the wrong bank accounts, which creates a lot of extra work for the saints managing and reconciling the accounts.
- Please refer to the details on the church announcements page on “How do I give offering?” or please see your district brothers regarding how to make electronic deposits and offerings to the church bank accounts.
